There were almost zero daily confirmed cases in Australia from February to October. But it had reached its peak in January and dropped to its lowest point in February. Despite occasional ups and downs, the overall trend is still downward.</p>

                <p class="lead">The death rates of Covid-19 from Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, and China are displayed on this graph. Really surprising is the Covid-19 mortality rate in China. However, from May 2020 to February 2021, the United Kingdom twice hit the summit. The United States has the highest death rate of Covid-19 from September 2021 to May 2022. Australia, however, had reached its pinnacle between July and October.</p>

                <p class="lead">This graph illustrates the immunisation rates in Australia, the US, the UK, and China. Initially, America had the greatest vaccination rate. China, however, started to climb to the little peak starting in February 2020. After then, America's vaccination rate increased a little, but from February 2020 to October 2022, China began to surpass America as the nation with the highest vaccination rate. Even if it fell to the lowest point from mid-September to mid-December, it is still the highest when compared to other nations.</p>

                <p class="lead">The entire Covid-19 test in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand are displayed on this graph. It is astonishing to discover that from May 2020 to June 2022, the United States had the largest number of tests. Australia comes in third place, followed by the United Kingdom. It is most likely because America has a greater population than these other countries, which results in higher test results.</p>

                </h2>
                <p class="lead">The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the infectious illness known as coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The majority of virus-infected individuals will have a mild to severe respiratory disease and will recover without the need for special care. However, some people will get serious illnesses and need to see a doctor. Serious sickness is more likely to strike older persons and those with underlying medical illnesses including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or chronic respiratory diseases. COVID-19 can cause anyone to get very ill or pass away at any age.</p>


                 <p class="lead"> Being knowledgeable about the illness and the virus's propagation is the greatest strategy to stop or slow down transmission. By keeping a distance of at least one metre between people, using a mask that fits properly, and often washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub, you may prevent infection in both yourself and other people. When it's your turn, get your vaccination, and abide by any local advice.</p>


                  <p class="lead"> When an infected person coughs, sneezes, speaks, sings, or breathes, the virus can spread from their mouth or nose in minute liquid particles. From larger respiratory droplets to tiny aerosols, these particles are diverse. It's crucial to use proper respiratory technique, such as coughing into a flexed elbow, and to confine yourself to your house and rest until you feel better.</p>
